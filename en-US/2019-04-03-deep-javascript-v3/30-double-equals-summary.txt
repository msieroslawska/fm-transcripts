And then once you have primitives prefer toNumber.
>> Kyle Simpson: And I'm just optimistic enough to believe that every developer from the junior developer with two weeks of experience in JavaScript, up to the experienced developer with 20 plus years, can understand a fairly straightforward system like that. And by understanding it, avoid the places where it can be problematic.

>> Kyle Simpson: So what are those problematic cases? Many of these are ones we've already seen, but let's talk about the corner cases, we gotta talk about them so that we can avoid them.
